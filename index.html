      <h2>WHAT MAKES US DREAM?</h2>
      <p>In the US, almost 50% of all adults will experience some form of mental illness in their lifetime. Millions are affected each year with debilitating anxiety disorder, Attention Deficit Disorder, Addiction, Eating Disorders, and Depression. And though not contagious, the ripple effects of mental illness spread through families, touching everyone in its wake. It’s important to understand the numbers because it shows that if you, or someone you love, are affected by the disease, you are not alone.
        It’s time to bring mental illness out of the shadows and into the light; to erase the stigma and raise awareness & advocate for increased understanding and health care. </p>
